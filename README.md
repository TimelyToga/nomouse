# nomouse

Trains you to use the keyboard by discouraging use of mouse. Every time you
left click, your screen dims by 20% of its maximum brightness and gets restored
over the next 20 seconds. This is supposed to be annoying and motivate you to
learn keyboard shortcuts.

Build with `make`; run with `bin/nomouse`.

todo: whitelist certain programs, read settings from config
